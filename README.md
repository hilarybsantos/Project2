# Project2

#In our original code, there was simply a box plot displaying food preferences over age. We decided to make a function that would plot the preferences of not only food this time, it could plot drink preferences as well. Then, we made a conditional statement that would plot both graphs of food and drink if prompted with the word "both."

#In order to organize the project files and data, subfiles named "Data" and "src" were made under the CPSC292 folder, and then the Project2 folder was in that folder. Further in, we included the data and src folder to separate the raw data and the visualizations.

#In order to run the conditional in the last chunk, "food", "drink", or "both" can be inputed into the vector at line 36.
